Usage: aggregateSignal bedfile chromosomesizes signal outfilePrefix [-n/--normalize <scalar>]
If -p/--printProfile option, will print per-base-pair signal for motif instances. Use with caution as it will create huge files.
	This requires a parameter for defining a uniformly sized window around each motif center: center +/- window.
	You need to set the window size at least as wide as half of your largest motif.
If -n/--normalize <scalar>, will normalize to a sequencing depth time a scalar value given with this option.

arguments:

1. bedfile - a bed file of regions to aggregate signal for

	The following format is anticipated:

	MtrunA17Chr0c01	46923	46933	CNS_1_all_Nfix_MtrunA17Chr0c01	.	+
	MtrunA17Chr0c01	46923	46933	CNS_1_all_Nfix_MtrunA17Chr0c01	.	-
	MtrunA17Chr0c01	74693	74849	CNS_2_all_Nfix_MtrunA17Chr0c01	.	+

2. chromosomesizes - a file listing the sequences (chromosomes) and their length, such as an .fai file
3. a per bp coverage file generated from an ATACseq data set, generated with bedtools genomecov, in bedGraph format
4. outfilePrefix - prefix for the output files. Specifically a <prefix>_aggregate.txt with values indicated. This file will present an aggregated signal for each region in the input which is the per bp coverage averaged over the regions

Note this program will skip mitochodrial sequences because mitochondrial data can be troublesome, notably in ATACseq experiments. 

When -n is used the ratio of per bp coverage in a region relative to the global (genome-wide) mean will be taken and averaged per bp for the signal values.

Use -n 1 to implement only depth normalization, which is implemented in the  Framework::normalize(double scalar) function.

Warning, the -p option is not recommended, but does work.
